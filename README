NAME
    RT::Extension::CustomField::Checkbox - extension for RT to add
    checkboxes and radio buttons based custom fields

DESCRIPTION
    Install it, register within @Plugins in the config. Enjoy.

ATTENTION FOR USERS OF RT 4.0
    You don't need this extension. RT 4.0 and newer has this functionality
    build in.

    If you're upgrading from RT 3.8 and used this extension then additinal
    steps may be required. At least RT 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 has no upgrade script
    to convert custom fields created by this extensions into 4.x CFs.

    Run the following SQL:

        UPDATE CustomFields SET Type = 'Select' AND RenderType = 'List'
        WHERE Type = 'SelectCheckbox';

    Delete this extension from @Plugins in the config file.

    Hopefuly in RT 4.0.2 all this would be automated.
