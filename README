NAME
    RT::Extension::CustomField::Checkbox (DEPRECATED) - extension for RT to
    add checkboxes and radio buttons based custom fields

DESCRIPTION
    Install it, register within @Plugins in the config. Enjoy.

ATTENTION FOR USERS OF RT 4.0
    You don't need this extension. RT 4.0 and newer has this functionality
    build in.

    RT 4.0.20 and 4.2.3 ship etc/upgrade/4.0-customfield-checkbox-extension
    which can upgrade these custom fields to be compatible with the RT 4.0
    core feature.
